## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Setting up Python Tkinter in VSCode

1. **Open VSCode** in your project folder.
2. **Create a new virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv f1
    ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    .\f1\Scripts\activate
    ```

## 📐 Using Pack and Grid Together

You can use both `pack` and `grid` geometry managers in a single program by nesting `grid` widgets inside a `Frame` that is packed.

**Example:**
```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import Frame, Label

root = tk.Tk()
f = Frame(root)

label = Label(f, text="User Name")
label1 = Label(f, text="Contact")

label.grid(row=0, column=0)
label1.grid(row=1, column=0)

# Center the frame
f.pack()

root.mainloop()
```
